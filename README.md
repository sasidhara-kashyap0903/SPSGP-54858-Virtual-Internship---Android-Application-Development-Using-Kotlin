## **Chapter-I**
### **1.1 Abstract:**
Shopping is one of the activities that some people consider part of their life, while others do not even think of it. This comparison makes us discover people's problems with shopping. People have shopping problems such as limited time, expats in foreign countries without cars, a transportation issue, people consider physical shopping as a waste of time, health issues, long-distance to market and the difficulty in obtaining some items. 

As the problems mentioned above, we have explored our idea, which is related to personal shopping. Therefore, we have built an application that combines different market shops, i.e. (Malls, supermarkets, and pharmacies). 

This personal grocery shopping is an innovative app that allows the customers to get all their needs and suggest items based on previous history. Then deliver items to their doorstep and can facilitate online shopping procedure where customers can browse unlimited products all at one time. This work supports people in exploiting their time to be safer and more accessible than wasting it physically.

Moreover, people can order the product from home instead of going around for long distances for shopping. In addition, this app could help people who are facing health problems and unable to buy something physically to avoid future problems.
 
Finally, some people do not have transportation methods for shopping, and they should keep pace with the evolution.
