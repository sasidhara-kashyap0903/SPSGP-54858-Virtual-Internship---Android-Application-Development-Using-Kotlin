# **GROCERY LIST APPLICATION USING KOTLIN IN ANDROID STUDIO**
## **Chapter-I**
### **1.1 Abstract:**
Shopping is one of the activities that some people consider part of their life, while others do not even think of it. This comparison makes us discover people's problems with shopping. People have shopping problems such as limited time, expats in foreign countries without cars, a transportation issue, people consider physical shopping as a waste of time, health issues, long-distance to market and the difficulty in obtaining some items. 

As the problems mentioned above, we have explored our idea, which is related to personal shopping. Therefore, we have built an application that combines different market shops, i.e. (Malls, supermarkets, and pharmacies). 

This personal grocery shopping is an innovative app that allows the customers to get all their needs and suggest items based on previous history. Then deliver items to their doorstep and can facilitate online shopping procedure where customers can browse unlimited products all at one time. This work supports people in exploiting their time to be safer and more accessible than wasting it physically.

Moreover, people can order the product from home instead of going around for long distances for shopping. In addition, this app could help people who are facing health problems and unable to buy something physically to avoid future problems.
 
Finally, some people do not have transportation methods for shopping, and they should keep pace with the evolution.
### **1.2 Objective:**
The main aim of this project is to list the items so that whenever users go to grocery stores, users will not be able to forget their items and this grocery application helps the users to tackle their day to day chaos more effortlessly. 
### **1.3 Problem Targeted:**
It’s not easy for the users to remember every item in this hectic lifestyle, they frequently can’t recall their required necessity so we decided to build an app to store the items in the database for their future use. After buying the items users can delete the added items in the database.
### **1.4 Problem's Primary Goals:**
The goal of this project is to make an app that stores the user items in a cart and can modify and delete the added item in the list. To develop a reliable system, I have some specific goals such as:

	Develop a system such that users can add item details like product name, product Quantity, and Product Price.

	Develop a database room that is used to store the user data which already been added by the user in the cart and the user can also remove the previously added item in the cart.

	Develop a good UI design that user friendly to the user.

	Develop a good UI that is supported for all android devices.

### **1.5 Introduction:**
We are going to build a grocery application in android using Android Studio. Many times we forget to purchase things that we want to buy, after all, we can’t remember all the items, so with the help of this app, you can note down your grocery items that you are going to purchase, by doing this you can’t forget any items that you want to purchase. In this project, we are using (MVVM) for architectural patterns, Room for database, Recycler View and Coroutines to display the list of items.
