### **ABSTRACT:**
Android is an open-source operating system that runs on the linux kernel. With the advent of
new mobile technologies, the mobile application industry is advancing rapidly. Consisting of
several operating systems like symbian OS, iOS, blackberry, etc., Android OS is recognized as
the most widely used, popular and user-friendly mobile platform. This open-source linux kernelbased operating system offers high flexibility due to its customization properties making it a
dominant mobile operating system.

Android applications are developed using the java language. Google has its own Software
Development Kit (SDK) which enables these java codes to control devices like mobile phones,
tablets, etc. Android mobile application development provides a flexible platform for developers
where they can use both java Integrated Development Environment (IDEs) and android java
libraries.

Google android SDK delivers a special software stack that provides developers an easy platform
to develop android applications. Moreover, developers can make use of existing java IDEs which
provides flexibility to the developers. Java libraries are predominant in the process of third-party
application development. Cross-platform approaches make sure that developers do not have to
develop platform-dependent applications. With the help of these approaches, an application can
be deployed to several platforms without the need for changes in coding. However, android is
more prone to security vulnerabilities which the majority of the users do not take into account.
Any android developer can upload their application on the android market which can cause a
security threat to any android device. These applications do not have to go through rigorous
security checks. In this report, a layered approach for android application development along
with various cross-platform approaches is discussed.
## **Chapter-I INTRODUCTION**
Android is an open source and Linux-based Operating System for mobile devices such
as smartphones and tablet computers. Android was developed by the Open Handset
Alliance, led by Google, and other companies.

Android offers a unified approach to application development for mobile devices which
means developers need only develop for Android, and their applications should be able
to run on different devices powered by Android.

The first beta version of the Android Software Development Kit (SDK) was released by
Google in 2007 where as the first commercial version, Android 1.0, was released in
September 2008.

On June 27, 2012, at the Google I/O conference, Google announced the next Android
version, 4.1 Jelly Bean. Jelly Bean is an incremental update, with the primary aim of
improving the user interface, both in terms of functionality and performance.

The source code for Android is available under free and open source software licenses.
Google publishes most of the code under the Apache License version 2.0 and the rest,
Linux kernel changes, under the GNU General Public License version 2.
### **1.1 Android Features and Applications:**
FEATURES:
➢ Android is a powerful operating system competing with Apple 4GS and supports
great features. Few of them are listed below :
• Beautiful UI
• Connectivity
• Storage
• Messaging
• Web browser
• Resizable widgets
• GCM
• Wi-Fi Direct
• Android Beam
 APPLICATIONS:
➢ Android applications are usually developed in the Java language using the Android
Software Development Kit. Once developed, Android applications can be
packaged easily and sold out either through a store such as Google Play,
SlideME, Opera Mobile Store, Mobango, F-droid and the Amazon Appstore.
